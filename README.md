### Focus: Practical Threat Hunting with Splunk Using Custom Log Queries & Dashboards

---

## Lab Summary

This project demonstrates how to detect threats in enterprise environments using **Splunk**, one of the most widely adopted SIEM platforms in the world. I installed Splunk in a virtual lab environment, ingested simulated event data, and performed searches to identify anomalies like brute-force attacks, suspicious logons, and privilege abuse.

Splunkâ€™s powerful query language (SPL) and visualization capabilities were used to build dashboards and perform live hunts, mimicking what analysts in SOCs do every day.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

* Splunk Enterprise 
* Data ingestion via Universal Forwarder / Local files
* Security-focused log parsing & filtering
* SPL (Search Processing Language)
* Alerting on suspicious login patterns
* Custom dashboards and reports

---

## Environment Setup

* **Splunk Enterprise** installed locally on Windows 10 VM
* Web interface accessed via `127.0.0.1:8000`
* Sample logs: Windows Security Event logs and synthetic logs
* Dashboards built inside Splunk UI

## Threat Hunting Queries & Scenarios

### Brute Force Login Detection

```spl
index=win_logs sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name, src_ip
| where count > 10
```

> âœ… Screenshot: Table showing repeated failed logins from one IP
> ![](./screenshots/repeated-failed-logins.png)

---

### Suspicious Admin Logon Times

```spl
index=win_logs sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4624
| eval Hour=strftime(_time, "%H")
| where Account_Name="Administrator" AND (Hour < 6 OR Hour > 20)
| stats count by Account_Name, src_ip, Hour
```

> âœ… Screenshot: Visual showing admin login outside business hours

---

### Excessive Privilege Use

```spl
index=win_logs EventCode=4672
| stats count by Account_Name, host
| where count > 5
```

> âœ… Screenshot: Highlighted user with high privilege use frequency
> ![](./screenshots/excessive-privilege-use.png)

---

## Dashboards

Custom dashboards were created to:

* Visualize login anomalies by user/IP
* Monitor administrative activity
* Display time-based event patterns

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

* Mirrors **real SOC workflows**: search, pivot, alert
* Uses industry-grade tooling (Splunk) in practical threat detection
* Shows **SPL proficiency** and analytical thinking
* Demonstrates log familiarity (Windows Event IDs, patterns)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This lab helped reinforce hands-on threat hunting skills using Splunk and real-world log data. It reflects my ability to triage, investigate, and visualize security events â€” and shows Iâ€™m ready to contribute in a SIEM-driven environment.
